Hello, I'm Ning! :) Welcome to my portfolio!

I have just completed my Google Data Analytics course and my first portfolio project:

Covid in ASEAN Countries + Top 3 Largest Populations

Data Viz (Tableau): https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ning.chang7904/viz/CovidASEAN_17195593903840/Dashboard1#1

SQL (done in BigQuery): https://github.com/ningstas/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/covid_202001_to_202406.sql

Steps taken:

- Retrieved data on cases, deaths and hospitalization from ourworldindata.org, and data on population (2022) and density (2021) from worldbank.org
- Imported them into Google Sheets to explore and clean and export as CSV
- Imported CSV into BigQuery and filtered according to scope of project and did further exploration (e.g. checking if the country names match across data sources)
- Joined tables to calculate percentages, numbers per million (for comparison across countries of different population sizes)
- Tried to answer my own questions: Did vaccines reduce the spread of the disease? Did vaccines reduce severity? Did population density affect the spread of the disease?
- Imported the results into Tableau for visualisation
