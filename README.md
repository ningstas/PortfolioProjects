# Hello, I'm Ning! :)

Welcome to my portfolio!

I recently completed my Google Data Analytics course and my first portfolio project at the end of June 2024.

I'm only at the beginning of my journey as I transition from a Project Manager to a Data Analyst, and any feedback on how or what to improve will be greatly appreciated! :)
